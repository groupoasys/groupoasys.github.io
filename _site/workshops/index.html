        <h1 id="oasys-workshops">OASYS WORKSHOPS</h1>

<p>The OASYS Workshops are thematic events that bring together multiple researchers—often including several international guests—for a series of talks and discussions around a shared topic. Designed to foster deeper scientific exchange, these workshops create a collaborative environment where participants can explore new ideas, receive feedback, and initiate joint research projects. By encouraging dialogue beyond institutional and national boundaries, the workshops play a key role in expanding the group’s international network and research impact.</p>

<p>The last decades have witnessed a revolution in information and communication technologies, leading to an explosion of data, observations, and measurements about physical and social processes. This exponential growth in data has opened new opportunities in Optimization-based Decision Making. The DYCON Seminar explored how this data can be used for two closely linked purposes: solving large and complex optimization problems that were previously intractable, and formulating mathematical optimization models that enable more confident decision-making about future outcomes. The OASYS research group welcomed invited speakers who shared their expertise and insights, fostering collaboration and advancing knowledge in this exciting field. Below, we include the list of selected talks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yves Rychener: <em>Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization with heterogeneous data sources</em></li>
  <li>Adrián Esteban Pérez: <em>Data-driven distributionally robust optimization under a common pattern structure</em></li>
  <li>Daniel Kuhn: <em>On the interplay of optimal transport and distributionally robust optimization</em></li>
</ul>
