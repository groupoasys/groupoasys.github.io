                <h3><u>MSOpt - Mathematical Methods for the Optimization of Decision-making Processes based on Multi-source Data</u></h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The last decades of human progress have witnessed a revolution in the development and implementation of information and communication technologies, leading to an explosion in the availability of data, observations, and measurements related to physical and social processes and systems. Today, the widespread use of data is crucial in diverse sectors of our society, such as communications, robotics, biology, and even in areas like politics, entertainment, and product and service commerce. In these and other sectors, data serves as a resource with enormous potential to provide value by enabling better decision-making, often in contexts characterized by high uncertainty. However, the effective utilization of data for decision-making is not without significant challenges and obstacles. These challenges are associated not only with the volume and complexity of data management but also, and especially, with its diverse origins and incomplete nature. Data often offers only a limited or biased view of the process or system from which it is obtained. In practice, however, it is not uncommon to encounter multiple decision-making processes within similar environments. These processes often face a shortage of individual-level data, yet collectively, they pool a substantial volume of valuable information. In this context, the main objective of this project is to generate knowledge, methods, and algorithms that facilitate the optimal use of information contained in data from multiple sources for decision-making under uncertainty. Additionally, we aim to create a mathematical framework that allows us to define and formalize the concept of the “value” of a dataset (understood as its capacity to improve the outcome of a decision) and develop methods for its quantification. This framework will then be used to discriminate between datasets that feed into the same decision-making process (or several analogous ones) but come from different sources (or providers). To develop these methods, we will employ advanced techniques in Stochastic Optimization, such as Distributionally Robust Optimization, and will need to generate new theoretical knowledge in this domain. Furthermore, to evaluate the mathematical methods derived from this project, we will apply them to address complex optimization and decision-making problems with high economic and/or social impact. This includes challenges arising from the necessary decarbonization of the energy sector and its imperative transition towards sustainability. Solving large-scale optimization problems will be a crucial aspect of this project, necessitating the development of tools that leverage data for the efficient resolution of such problems, potentially utilizing machine learning techniques.</p>

                <h3><u>FlexAnalytics - Advanced Analytics to Empower the Small Flexible Consumers of Electricity</u></h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Could small consumers of electricity compete in the wholesale markets on an equal footing with the other market agents? Yes, they can and FlexAnalytics will show how. Activating the demand response, although a major challenge, may also bring with it tremendous benefits to society, with potential cost savings in the billions of euros. This project will exploit methods of inverse problems, multi-level programming and machine learning to develop a pioneering system that enables the active participation of a group of price-responsive consumers of electricity in the wholesale electricity markets. Through this, they will be able to make the most out of their flexible consumption. FlexAnalytics proposes a generalized scheme for so-called inverse optimization that materializes in a novel data-driven approach to the market bidding problem that, unlike existing approaches, combines the tasks of forecasting, model formulation and estimation, and decision-making in an original unified theoretical framework. The project will also address big-data challenges, as the proposed system will leverage weather, market, and demand information to capture the many factors that may affect the price-response of a pool of flexible consumers. On a fundamental level, FlexAnalytics will produce a novel mathematical framework for data-driven decision making. On a practical level, FlexAnalytics will show that this framework can facilitate the best use of a large amount and a wide variety of data to efficiently operate the sustainable energy systems of the future.</p>

                <h3><u>DYCON - Data-driven Optimization Under a Dynamic Context</u></h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The last decades of human progress have witnessed a revolution in the development and deployment of information and communication technologies. This revolution has led to, among other things, an explosion in the amount of information, in the form of data, observations and measurements, about physical and social processes and systems. The exponential growth of the amount of data available has brought about new opportunities in the field of Optimization-based Decision Making. Of all of them, in this particular project, the research team explore the possibility of using this data for two different, but closely linked, purposes, namely: the resolution of large and complex optimization problems, which, until now, have proved extremely difficult to solve; and the mathematical formulation of optimization models that allow making decisions with a higher level of confidence about their future outcome.</p>

                <h3><u>QUALIFICA Andalusia Regional Government Excellence Programme: Mathware for the operation and planning of intelligent and sustainable energy systems</u></h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The motivation behind this action is to grant funding, with the purpose of strengthening Andalusian university research institutes, R&D&I Centres and Infrastructures' bids for "Severo Ochoa" or "María de Maeztu" seals of excellence. The purpose is to promote the development and implementation of actions aimed at improving already submitted applications, in order to achieve a better position for accreditation. The "Severo Ochoa" and "María de Maeztu" Centres of Excellence and "María de Maeztu Units of Excellence" accreditations recognise the best research centres and units that stand out for the relevance and impact of their results worldwide. In this framework, Mathware for the operation and planning of intelligent and sustainable energy systems is one of the research lines of the Unidad de Investigación en Matemáticas iMAT led by J.M. Morales and E. Carrizosa. The design, development and implementation of tools for the planning and operation of coupled gas-electric energy systems, with the possibility to transport hydrogen (mixed) through the gas infrastructure, and of active distribution networks (smart grids). These tools will be based on Mathematical Optimization and Data Science and require the design, study and implementation of algorithms and/or procedures to solve large non-convex optimization problems with integer variables. These algorithms and/or procedures may range from convex (conservative) approximations and decomposition methods to the application of mathheuristics.</p>
